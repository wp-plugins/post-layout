== Description ==

Add HTML o javascript code before, after or in the middle of the content without modify the theme.

The plugin is VERY useful to everyone need to add AdSense or other advertising code in the post
body (befor, after or in the middle of them). The plugin injects the code without modify the theme
used and is "theme indipendant", so you can change the theme and the won't stop to display.

The plugin can inject such code in the comment form, too, and after the last comment: those two positions
are useful for blogs with a lot of comments, so there will be ads even in the bottom of a long page.

Users of 2.5 version of WordPress: the upgrade probably broken your comments count. Use the plugin
"Comments number restore" to solve that issues.

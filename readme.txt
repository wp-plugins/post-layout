Total control of your posts layout: adds code (Google AdSense, ...) before, after and in the middle of a post or anywhere with a block short tag.

== Description ==

I'm not a programmer, I cannot modify my theme so:

* How can I put my Google AdSense code in my posts?
* How can I add generic HTML/JavaScript code in my posts?
* How can I add a piece of code in a particular position of a specific post?
* How can I add a piece of **PHP code** in a post and **get it executed**?
* How can I put the **Mobile Google AdSense ads** in my posts when the site is browsed with a mobile phone (and leave the classic ones otherwise)?
* ...

The answer to all those questions (and many others) is with **Post Layout**.

Post Layout give you an incredible flexibility to insert whatever you want in posts and pages
body. Adding JavaScript or HTML created by Google AdSense, Amazon, BidVertiser, Chitika and so on
is a matter of copy and paste. No programming skills needed. No more troubly WordPress themes modification.

And when you cange the theme... all continues to work.

The plugin is VERY useful to everyone need to add AdSense or other advertising code in the post
body (before, after or in the middle of them). The plugin injects the code without modify the theme
used and is "theme independent", so you can change the theme and the custom code you added won't stop to display.

The plugin can inject such code in the comment form, too, and after the last comment: those two positions
are useful for blogs with a lot of comments, so there will be ads even in the bottom of a long page.
